# zoom-chat-formatter

A simple script to format the captured Zoom chat into a readable form.

Additionally, it can detect individual presentations from the transcript and annotate the chat with the information about who's presenting.

Save the chat and transcript (captured along with the meeting recording) to `chat.txt` and `transcript.vtt` and run `main.py`. If you want to skip transcript parsing, comment out the corresponding lines.
